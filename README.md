# Python Graphing Calculator
A simple Python graphing calculator that allows users to plot mathematical expressions on a graph.

Just to clarify, this is a graphing calculator that no one asked for! I simply got bored one day, wanted to mess around with Turtle Graphics in Python, and created this.

## Requirements
- [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Installation
1. Download the project files.
2. Make sure you have Python 3 installed on your system.

## Usage
1. Execute the calculator by running `python graphing_calculator.py` in your terminal or command prompt.
2. The calculator will prompt you to enter an origin point for the graph.
3. You can then set up axis ticks by specifying the space between them.
4. Enter a mathematical expression (e.g., `x**2`) to plot it on the graph.
5. The graph will be displayed, showing the plotted expression based on your settings.

### Example
```plaintext
Enter pixel coordinates of origin: 400,300
Enter ratio of pixels per step: 30
Enter an arithmetic expression: x**2
```
